# Nutro - Nutrient Ranking Tool

Determining the nutrition content of foods is a tedious, but necessary task for anyone interested in maintaining a specific diet. Our tool allows you to quickly sort though tens of thousands of food items in order to find the best foods to help you reach your goals. Our data has been sourced from the USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. 

An additional goal for this project is the comparison of two different sorting algorithms in order to further our understanding of algorithmic complexity. When using Nutro, you can select between these two algorithms and view them in action. We also give a count of the comparisons and swaps, as well as the recorded time of each algorithm. It should be noted that the time metric will be influenced by your machine's specifications.

# Features
- Compare 7000+ common foods
